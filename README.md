# BERT-Email-Classification

Predict whether an email is a spam or not using BERT

Data - spam.csv

What is Down Sampling technique to handle data imbalance
- ham email count 4825
- spam email count 747
- 15% is spam email and 85% is ham email making it imbalance so down sampling technique is to pick random ham 4825 and only get 747 samples to match spam
- that way you will have equal number of ham and spam of 747
